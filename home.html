            <h3>About me</h3>

            <p>Hello! My name is Christopher, and I am a 20 year old Computer Science student from Norway. 
            I'm currently in my first year at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
            Right now I've learned Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the most fun I had last semester
            was making a website for a project :D. I'm currently learning Java which is harder but I think
            its more fun to learn than Python, since you can create larger programs. 
            <br>
            Like for example I've made a Merchant class and Item class that interacts with eachother, like 
            in a video game. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When I'm not coding or doing schoolwork, I like to excercise especially to go cross-country skiing or running outside!
                I also like to play video games, if I have time.
            </p>
        
        </div>

        <div id = "skills">
            <h3>Coding Skills</h3>

            <p>So far I can say for sure that I'm best at front-end, and HTML and CSS is what I understand the most.
                But I also like programming in JavaScript, as I find the syntax very easy to comprehend and apply to the website.
                I think JavaScript is good, because you can easily see what you're doing with your code
            </p>

            <p>
                I really like using API, and I've managed to fetch the APOD of the day:
