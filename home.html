            <p>Hello! My name is Christopher, and I am a 20 year old Computer Science student from Norway. 
            I'm currently in my first year at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
            Right now I've learned Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the most fun I had last semester
            was making a website for a project :D. I'm currently learning Java which is harder but I think
            its more fun to learn than Python, since you can create larger programs. 
            <br>
            Like for example I've made a Merchant class and Item class that interacts with eachother, similary
            like a video game.
